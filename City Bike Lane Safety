# For this project, I downloaded City Bike Lane Safety data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert the data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes (
id integer primary key,
year_installed year not null,
year_updated year not null,
street varchar not null,
width_feet integer not null,
safetyrating integer not null,
protected varchar not null)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Find the average safetyrating for each bike lane from the CTE.
Then, filter to only the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher and creates a label for these bike lanes that says "Safe Lane"
WITH BikeLaneSafety AS 
(SELECT cbl.street, AVG(cbl.safetyrating) as average_safetyrating
FROM CityBikeLanes cbl
GROUP BY cbl.street)

SELECT street, average_safetyrating, 'Safe Lane' as tag
FROM BikeLaneSafety
WHERE average_safetyrating>= 4
